# Video 1.9: Fundamental concepts of code reusability
The code in this branch was used in video 1.9 of video course Design patterhs with Java 9. 
This brach contains code to demonstrate fundamental concepts of code reusability. 

# Design Principles
Software design principles represent a set of guidelines that helps us to avoid having a bad design.

## DRY 
Don’t Repeat Yourself is a software development principle, the main aim of which is to reduce repetition of code.
## WET
Write Every Time is a cheeky abbreviation to mean the opposite i.e. code that doesn’t adhere to DRY principle.

## Advantages of DRY

### Maintainability
If password for data base connection changes, then you have to make change only at one place. 

### Reuse
DRY inherently promotes reuse of code because we are merging 2 or more instances of repeating code into a single block of code. Reusable code pays of in the long run as it speeds development time.

### Cost
More code costs more. More code takes more people more time to maintain and to address bugs.

### Testing
If code is not repeated, you just have to test one main path. Of course, different behaviors still need to be tested.
